# Win-PC-Monitor
Python parser for http://openhardwaremonitor.org/ remote web server

I am using this python script to read the temperature sensors of my windows computers and display them in home assistant. For this script to work the windows pcs must be running http://openhardwaremonitor.org/ with remote web server enabled and its port opened in windows firewall.
